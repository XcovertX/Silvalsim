"# Silvalsim" 

main class is located at src/main/java/start/Silvalsim.java

Based on what I am thinking at the moment, I will most likely utilize the following design patterns:

- Factory Pattern: to reduce duplicate code in the creation of polymorphic objects. Specifically, I could see using this building startups

- Command Pattern: to execute the turn based battle system

- Decorator Pattern: to augment the functionality of the cycle controlling class.
